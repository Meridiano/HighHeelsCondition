[HighHeelsOffset]
# This custom Actor Value contains actor's high heels offset value
# If actor has no high heels active this is equal to 0.0
# If actor has high heels active this value is positive float
# In both cases you can get it via Papyrus Game.GetPlayer().GetActorValue("HighHeelsOffset")
# You can also use it in your conditions as "Mood" if you make a specific patch for your plugin
